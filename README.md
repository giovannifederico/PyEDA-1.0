# PyEDA-1.0

PyEDA is a simple client-server tool to manage EDA (Electrodermal Activity) experiments in Python.<br>
It can be used with any Pyhon-powered software environments (e.g., PsychoPy).<br>
The client-server communication via TCP socket allows a simple triggers management.<br>
<br>
PyEDA has been tested with a low-cost home-made device based on the Seeduino v. 4.0 (http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino_Lotus/) and the GSR Grove sensor v. 1.1 (http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GSR_Sensor/).<br>
<br>
Any serial device based on analog EDA measurement (expressed in bits) should work.
